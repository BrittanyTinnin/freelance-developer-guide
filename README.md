# The Freelancer Developer Guide

### Purpose

The purpose of this document/repository is to serve as a guide as well as a resource for new developers who intend on becoming freelance web developers. The intention is to provide a comprehensive guide for code newbies to land their first coding job online.

In addition to this, people who intend on contributing to a repository but do not know how or where can use this repo as a means to get their foot wet. In recent years, Git & GitHub contribution and knowledge of Markdown have become prerequisites to acquiring a web development job. People will be able to contribute to this document in an effort to make it as comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date as possible. By extension, they would have contributed to a repository.

I am also a newbie and as such, I don't know everything but I'm always open to learning. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_codemonk) point out any corrections cited or to provide any encouragements or insights.

As we embark on this journey together, I urge your to make the FIVE (5) _W's_ of Life part of your Life

- **WHO** you are is what makes you special. Do not change for anyone
- **WHAT** lies ahead will always be a mystery. Do not be afraid to explore.
- **WHEN** life pushes you over, you push back harder.
- **WHERE** there are choices to make, make the one you won't regret.
- **WHY** things happen will never be certain. Take it in strides and move forward.

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution and as always, HAPPY CODING!
